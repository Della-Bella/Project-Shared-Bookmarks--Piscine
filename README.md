ðŸ“Œ About This Project

This is a JavaScript learning project where I built a simple bookmark-sharing web app. It allows users to save and display bookmarked links with short descriptions.
I focus on JavaScript logic rather than styling, so this project uses only HTML and JavaScript and minimal CSS.

ðŸš€ Features

* Users can add a new bookmark by submitting a form (URL, title, and description).
* A dropdown menu lets users select a profile to view saved bookmarks.
* Bookmarks are displayed in reverse chronological order (newest first).
* Each bookmark title is a clickable link to the saved URL.
* Data is managed using provided storage functions.

ðŸ›  Technologies Used

* HTML â€“ Structure of the webpage
* JavaScript â€“ Handles logic and interactions
* CSS minimal style
* Storage.js â€“ Manages user and bookmark data
